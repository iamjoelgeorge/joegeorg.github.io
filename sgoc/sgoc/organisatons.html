						&quot;There is a different way to destroy our enemies. It is by ending hatred, and by destroying the root causes of enmity that we have to ‘destroy’ our enemies. Prayer for our so called enemies, initiative for restoring justice, forgiveness, sincere efforts to clarify misunderstandings through dialogue etc. will wipe out enemity and conflicts paving the way for peace and harmony. Let us walk in this light of Christ while wishing and praying that the terrorists and fanatics all over the world could also understand the life giving and rejuvenating positive way. May the Holy Spirit help us to experience Christ the Prince of Peace who taught us to be love and light in this world of violence, conflicts and injustice.
